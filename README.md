This github repo is a record of my 100 Days of Code challenge. Below I will have projects I have worked on during the challenge
and also a daily log of what I did each day.

[A Simple User Login Program](https://github.com/TheRevTasticTJ/Loginsystem)

## Daily Log

Day 1: Worked through Section 1 - 2 and started on Section 3 of the Zero to Mastery Python Development Course.

Day 2: Continued on in Section 3 of the Zero to Mastery Python Development Course.

Day 3: Just like Day 2, continued on through Section 3, this time almost finishing with it to be able to move onto Section 4
(Python Baiscs II).

Day 4: Completed Section 3 of the Zero to Mastery Python course and moved onto the next section of Python basics.

Day 5: Started onto Section 4 of Zero to Mastery Python Development and started to learn how to actually create different types
of code blocks and more.

Day 6: Made my way partially through Section 4 of the course and worked on an excercise that was given to further learn
conditional logic.

Day 7: Completed Section 4 of the course and completed the Python Exam at the end of the section. Also worked my way through
Section 5: Developer Environment.

Day 8: Completed setting up my Developer Enviroment using VS Code and PYCHARM and began learning OOP in Section 6 of the Zero
to Mastery course.

Day 9: Continued to learn about OOP in Python in Section 6. Learned about the 4 pillars (encapsulation, abstraction,
inheritance, and polymorphism).

Day 10: Completed Section 6 of the Python course and moved onto the next one which is about Functional Programming.
Also started the work of learning what I would need to do and code first for an automatic time tracker made in Python.

Day 11: Continued through Section 7 of the course and learned about pure functions, map(), filter(), zip(), and reduce ().

Day 12: Finished up with Section 7 by learning about Lambda expression and list/set/dictionary comprehension.

Day 13: Started to work on learning Decorators in Section 8 of the course.

Day 14: Completed the section on Decorators in Python and moved onto Error Handling in Section 9.

Day 15: Completed Section 9 and 10 of the course.

Day 16: Began Section 11 and started to learn about Modules in Python.

Day 17: Continued working though Section 11 and created a guessing number game from scratch.

Day 18: Continued through Section 11 and changed the code around in the guessing game that was created on the previous day to
use implement a while loop instead of a for loop and to have a valueerror exception added in as well.

Day 19: Completed Section 11, 12, and 13. Moved onto learning about Regular Expressions.

Day 20: Finished Sections 14, 15, and 16 of the course and moved onto the first of projects to create using the course!

Day 21: Created a Image Converter as my first project with Python while following the Zero to Mastery course!

Day 22: Created a PDF file merger and played around with the PyPDF2 module while also creating some other small projects using
it.

Day 23: Created a program following the course that allowed me to send out emails using my own Gmail address credentials.

Day 24: Started the Web Development section of the Python course and learned how to start a virtual enviorment so that I could
use Flask. Also set up a Flask server. Began work on a very simple Python Discord bot to further my learning.

Day 25: Worked further on the Discord bot to use on a personal server that I am apart of with friends, figured out how to make
it so that only people in the Admin role can use certain commands. Also worked on porting over an Automatic Time Tracker that
somebody else made in an earlier version of Python to Python 3.

Day 26: Continued on in the Python course with learning Flask and working on a personal portfolio website using Python and
Flask. Started work on a beginner project of creating a Login system as well (yes I know I have a lot of projects going).

Day 27: Finished the Web Development section of the ZtM Python course. Continued work on the login syste, started creating a
blackjack card game in Python and added the repo for the game above to personal projects.

Day 28: Continued work on the blackjack game and started a complete rewrite of it to flesh out the actual game before moving
onto making the code into OOP with clearly defined functions.

Day 29: Completed the simple blackjack game by finishing the complete rewrite of the entire program which can be found above
under personal projects.

Day 30: Started and completed the Web Scraping section of the Zero to Mastery course and started on the Automation/Testing
section. Started work on personal website to be used as a portfolio, blog (already up and running
[HERE](https://blog.taylorwjones.com), and online resume.

Day 31: Started and continued on with the Automation/Testing portion of the course and learned how to use Selenium.

Day 32: Completed the Automation/Testing section and moved onto the final section of Machine Learning and Data Science.

Day 33: Started work on a web scraper and a simple login system (this is different from the last one and actually works).

Day 34: Finished the main functionality of the login system, started to work on getting the loops to work properly and setup
password hashing.

Day 35: Completed the login system with password hashing and looping. Started ground work on a new project for a reddit bot
and began following along with a django and flask tutorial.

Day 36: Started working on a program that can display the n digits of Pi.

Day 37: Finished the Pi digit generator and started work on following a tutorial on making a blog like platform with Flask.

Day 38: Continued following along side the Flask tutorial. Started doing research and preliminary work in creating a CLI To-Do List (typing out all features I would like to create for it to have and how it will work).

Day 39: Continued work on the to-do list project. Did research on how others did there's and contemplated what to actually implement into my own version.

Day 40: Picked up where I left off in the Learn Python 3 The Hard Way book to help further understand some concepts that I have not fully grasped yet. Will probably finish this book and then move onto finishing Automate the Boring Stuff and finish that as well.

Day 41: Did some work on my personal website, purchased a bootstrap theme and started to incorporate my own information and also set it up to use Flask.

Day 42: Continued reading through Learn Python 3 the Hard Way and started to learn more about data structure (something I am struggling with).

Day 43: Started work on a homework assignment that was given from the Learn Python 3 the Hard Way book which is to create a simple text driven game where the player has decisions to make.

Day 44: Continued work on the homework assignment and finished up some of the major functions of the game. 

Day 45: Finished the first revision of the game for the homework

Day 46: Realized that the code I created wouldn't work properly how I wanted to so rewrote the entire game again to be simpler and have less functionality and completed the game.

Day 47: Had to take a break for a few days due to other priorities but today I created a little program to tell me how much from my 2 paychecks a month I would need to put towards my portion of bills I pay with my girlfriend because I got lazy doing it myself.
