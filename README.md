## Daily Log

Day 1: Worked through Section 1 - 2 and started on Section 3 of the Zero to Mastery Python Development Course.

Day 2: Continued on in Section 3 of the Zero to Mastery Python Development Course.

Day 3: Just like Day 2, continued on through Section 3, this time almost finishing with it to be able to move onto Section 4
(Python Baiscs II).

Day 4: Completed Section 3 of the Zero to Mastery Python course and moved onto the next section of Python basics.

Day 5: Started onto Section 4 of Zero to Mastery Python Development and started to learn how to actually create different types
of code blocks and more.

Day 6: Made my way partially through Section 4 of the course and worked on an excercise that was given to further learn
conditional logic.

Day 7: Completed Section 4 of the course and completed the Python Exam at the end of the section. Also worked my way through
Section 5: Developer Environment.

Day 8: Completed setting up my Developer Enviroment using VS Code and PYCHARM and began learning OOP in Section 6 of the Zero
to Mastery course.

Day 9: Continued to learn about OOP in Python in Section 6. Learned about the 4 pillars (encapsulation, abstraction,
inheritance, and polymorphism).

Day 10: Completed Section 6 of the Python course and moved onto the next one which is about Functional Programming.
Also started the work of learning what I would need to do and code first for an automatic time tracker made in Python.

Day 11: Continued through Section 7 of the course and learned about pure functions, map(), filter(), zip(), and reduce ().

Day 12: Finished up with Section 7 by learning about Lambda expression and list/set/dictionary comprehension.

Day 13: Started to work on learning Decorators in Section 8 of the course.

Day 14: Completed the section on Decorators in Python and moved onto Error Handling in Section 9.

Day 15: Completed Section 9 and 10 of the course.

Day 16: Began Section 11 and started to learn about Modules in Python.

Day 17: Continued working though Section 11 and created a guessing number game from scratch.

Day 18: Continued through Section 11 and changed the code around in the guessing game that was created on the previous day to
use implement a while loop instead of a for loop and to have a valueerror exception added in as well.

Day 19: Completed Section 11, 12, and 13. Moved onto learning about Regular Expressions.

Day 20: Finished Sections 14, 15, and 16 of the course and moved onto the first of projects to create using the course!

Day 21: Created a Image Converter as my first project with Python while following the Zero to Mastery course!

Day 22: Created a PDF file merger and played around with the PyPDF2 module while also creating some other small projects using
it.

Day 23: Created a program following the course that allowed me to send out emails using my own Gmail address credentials.

Day 24: Started the Web Development section of the Python course and learned how to start a virtual enviorment so that I could
use Flask. Also set up a Flask server. Began work on a very simple Python Discord bot to further my learning.

Day 25: Worked further on the Discord bot to use on a personal server that I am apart of with friends, figured out how to make
it so that only people in the Admin role can use certain commands. Also worked on porting over an Automatic Time Tracker that
somebody else made in an earlier version of Python to Python 3.

Day 26: Continued on in the Python course with learning Flask and working on a personal portfolio website using Python and
Flask. Started work on a beginner project of creating a Login system as well (yes I know I have a lot of projects going).
