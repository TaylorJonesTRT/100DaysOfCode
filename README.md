Day 3: Just like Day 2, continued on through Section 3, this time almost finishing with it to be able to move onto Section 4 (Python Baiscs II).

Day 4: Completed Section 3 of the Zero to Mastery Python course and moved onto the next section of Python basics.

Day 5: Started onto Section 4 of Zero to Mastery Python Development and started to learn how to actually create different types of code blocks and more.

Day 6: Made my way partially through Section 4 of the course and worked on an excercise that was given to further learn conditional logic.
